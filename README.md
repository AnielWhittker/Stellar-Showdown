# Project-3-COP3530-Stellar Showdown
Welcome to our interactive Streamlit web application, designed to give you an immersive experience comparing the efficiencies of various sorting algorithms. The application uses star data from the HYG Database, providing a real-world context to make learning algorithms more engaging and practical. You can choose to sort the stars by distance from Earth or temperature and select from a range of sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Bogo Sort, Random Sort, Shell Sort, and others. On executing the 'Sort' operation, the app measures and displays the time taken, providing a real-time comparison of the efficiencies of different algorithms. For those of you interested in astronomy, there's also an option to display the last 25 stars in the sorted list. With the ability to reset and rerun the app, you can explore different combinations at your own pace.

This application has been a team effort brought to you by Neema Owji, Maxwell Evans, and Aniel Whittaker Melian. We hope you find it useful and enjoyable, whether you're studying data structures and algorithms or simply exploring the stars.
