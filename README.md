# Project-3-COP3530-Stellar Showdown
Welcome to our interactive Streamlit web application, designed to give you an immersive experience in understanding and comparing the efficiencies of various sorting algorithms. The application uses star data from the HYG Database, providing a real-world context to make learning algorithms more engaging and practical. You can choose the range of stars to be sorted. You can choose to sort the stars by distance from Earth or temperature and select from a range of sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, TimSort, Bogo Sort, Bitonic Sort, and Insertion. On executing the 'Sort' operation, the app measures and displays the time taken, providing a real-time comparison of the efficiencies of different algorithms. For those of you interested in astronomy, there's also an option to display the top 25 and bottom 26 stars in the sorted list. With the ability to reset to continue sorting, you can explore different combinations at your own pace. You can also sort using all algorithms, but only 16384 stars. Also, you can see the code used to implement the different sorting algorithms. In addition, you can display a report that gives you the time taken for the different sorting algorithms.

This application has been a team effort brought to you by Neema Owji (student at UF), Maxwell Evans (student at UF), and Aniel Whittaker Melian (student at UF). We hope you find it useful and enjoyable, whether you're studying data structures and algorithms or simply exploring the stars.
